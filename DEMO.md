### 1. Install Conda

Already installed globally on my system. If you don't have Conda installed, you can download it from [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

### 2. Create a new Conda environment

```bash
conda create --name multi-lang-demo python=3.8 nodejs
```

This command creates a new environment named `multi-lang-demo`, installing Python 3.8 and Node.js into it.

### 3. Activate the Conda environment

```bash
conda activate multi-lang-demo
```

### 4. Python package management

Install a Python package to demonstrate managing Python dependencies:

```bash
conda install flask
```

Here's a simple Flask app to show the installed package worked.

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World from Flask!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("Running Flask app...")
    app.run()
```

### 5. Node.js package Management

```bash
npm install express
```
Here's a simple Express app to show the installed package worked.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World from Express!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

### 6. Run the applications
  
```bash
conda activate multi-lang-demo
python app.py
```

```bash
conda activate multi-lang-demo
node server.js
```

### 7. Benefits

- **Unified Environment Management**: One environment for both Python and Node.js dependencies.
- **Simple and efficient**: Simplifies the workflow and reduces the complexity of managing multiple language environments.
- **Reproducible**: All developers work with the same environment setup and no "it works on my machine" problems.

### 8. Clean-up

```bash
conda deactivate
conda remove --name multi-lang-demo --all
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json package.json
```
